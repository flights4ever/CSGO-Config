# CSGO-Config
This is a live version of my CSGO Config file, as I change it on my PC, It will update here.

If you do not know how to setup the file so you can use my config in your game, and have it update with a simple git pull, there are many turoials out there to help.
I will be doing lots of Pushes to this repo as I change my config.
I hope you enjoy it, I recommend taking inspiration from my config and using some of the code in yours, it is never reccomended to use another's config.
As you need to personalise your own to have it as you like it.

If you have any questions, add me on steam, and don't forget to leave a comment or I will ignore you.
